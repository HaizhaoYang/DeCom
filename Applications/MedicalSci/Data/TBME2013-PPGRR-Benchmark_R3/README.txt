****Revisions****

r3 11/02/2015 adds demographics information such as weight, age and ventilation mode to meta structure

r2 01/05/2013 fixes erronous reference.hr.pleth that were privously imported from signal that was not corrected for artifacts
              adds signal.ecg, labels.ecg, and reference.hr.ecg ; allows to compare hr against ECG

Each mat file is one case of 8 minutes.
Structures names are:
% param: samplingrates and case name, ventilation mode
% meta:  meta information such as demographics
% signal: raw co2 and pleth signals
% labels: labels for beats, breaths and artifacts obtained from a human rater
% reference: trends derived from labels
% SFresults: RR obtained using Smart Fusion approach, and steps thereof
