PURPOSE

The PhysIO Toolbox provides model-based physiological noise correction of 
fMRI data using peripheral measures of respiration and cardiac pulsation. 
It incorporates noise models of cardiac/respiratory phase (RETROICOR, 
Glover et al. 2000), as well as heart rate variability and respiratory 
volume per time (cardiac response function, Chang et. al, 2009, respiratory 
response function, Birn et al. 2006). The toolbox is usable via the SPM 
batch editor, performs automatic pre-processing of noisy peripheral data 
and outputs nuisance regressor files directly suitable for SPM 
(multiple_regressors.txt).

BACKGROUND

The PhysIO Toolbox provides physiological noise correction for fMRI-data 
from peripheral measures (ECG/pulse oximetry, breathing belt). It is 
model-based, i.e. creates nuisance regressors from the physiological 
monitoring that can enter a General Linear Model (GLM) analysis, e.g. 
SPM8/12. Furthermore, for scanner vendor logfiles (PHILIPS, GE, Siemens), 
it provides means to statistically assess peripheral data (e.g. heart rate variability) 
and recover imperfect measures (e.g. distorted R-peaks of the ECG).

Facts about physiological noise in fMRI:
- Physiological noise can explain 20-60 % of variance in fMRI voxel time 
  series (Birn2006, Hutton2011, Harvey2008.
	- Physiological noise affects a lot of brain regions (s. figure, e.g. 
      brainstem or OFC), especially next to CSF, arteries (Hutton2011). 
	- If not accounted for, this is a key factor limiting sensitivity for 
      effects of interest.
- Physiological noise contributions increase with field strength; they 
  become a particular concern at and above 3 Tesla (Kasper2009, Hutton2011).
- In resting state fMRI, disregarding physiological noise leads to wrong 
  connectivity results (Birn2006).

=> Some kind of physiological noise correction is highly recommended for 
   every statistical fMRI analysis.

Model-based correction of physiological noise: 
- Physiological noise can be decomposed into periodic time series following 
  heart rate and breathing cycle.
- The Fourier expansion of cardiac and respiratory phases was introduced as 
  RETROICOR (RETROspective Image CORrection, Glover2000, 
  see also Josephs1997).
- These Fourier Terms can enter a General Linear Model (GLM) as nuisance 
  regressors, analogous to movement parameters.
- As the physiological noise regressors augment the GLM and explain 
  variance in the time series, they increase sensitivity in all contrasts 
  of interest.
		

FEATURES OF THIS TOOLBOX

Physiological Noise Modeling :
- Modeling physiological noise regressors from peripheral data 
  (breathing belt, ECG, pulse oximeter) 
- State of the art RETROICOR cardiac and respiratory phase expansion
- Cardiac response function (Chang et al, 2009) and respiratory response 
  function (Birn et al. 2006) modelling of heart-rate variability and 
  respiratory volume  per time influence on physiological noise
- Flexible expansion orders to model different contributions of cardiac, 
  respiratory and interaction terms (see Harvey2008, Hutton2011)
- Automatic creation of nuisance regressors, full integration into standard 
  GLMs, tested for SPM8/12 ("multiple_regressors.mat")

Flexible Read-in:
The toolbox is dedicated to seamless integration into a clinical research s
etting and therefore offers correction methods to recover physiological 
data from imperfect peripheral measures.
- General Electric logfiles
- Siemens logfiles (synchronization via DICOM time stamp or tics time scale)
- Philips SCANPHYSLOG-file handling, including automatic alignment of scan volume timing and physiological time series 
  from logged gradient timecourses
