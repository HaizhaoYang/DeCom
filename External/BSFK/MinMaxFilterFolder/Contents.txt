Main Functions:
	minmaxfilt.m -> Matlab file multi-dimensional min/max filter
        minmaxfilt1.m -> Matlab file one-dimensional min/max filter
	KramerBruckner.m -> Matlab file for Kramer & Bruckner filter

Other files:
	minmaxfilter_install.m -> Installation function (mex build)
	slowminmaxfilt_algo.m -> Matlab file to illustrates how
                             the basic Lemire's algorithm works
    benchminmax.m -> Benchmark among four methods: 
        1. Matlab vectorized using Hankel,
        2. for-loop,
        3. Lemire's MEX
        4. Van Herk's method by Frederico D'Almeida
	testminmaxfilt.m -> Test program of Min/Max fitering Package

    lemire_nd_minengine.c -> MEX file for multiple 1D min engine (running min)
    lemire_nd_maxengine.c -> MEX file for multiple 1D max engine (running max)
    lemire_nd_minengine.m -> help file for MEX file lemire_nd_minengine.c
    lemire_nd_maxengine.m -> help file for MEX file lemire_nd_maxengine.c

    demolena.m -> demo KramerBruckner filtering
    lena_std.tif -> no need for presentation!
	Contents.txt -> This file
    vanherk.m -> Frederico D'Almeida's implementation of 
		 van Herk algorithm

Those files are kept for backward compatibility, but no longer used
    lemire_engine.c -> MEX file for single 1D engine (running min/max)
    lemire_nd_engine.c -> MEX file for multiple 1D engine (running min/max)
    lemire_engine.m -> help file for MEX file lemire_engine.c
