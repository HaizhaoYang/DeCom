nufft1df90.f contains NUFFT routines of types 1,2,3 with dynamic F90 
workspace allocation.

nufft1df77.f contains NUFFT routines of types 1,2,3 with static F77 
workspace allocation in the calling (driver) routine.

next235.f contains a utility routine that finds a highly composite 
integer greater than a given number.
